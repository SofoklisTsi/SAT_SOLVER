## Features

- **DPLL Algorithm**: Implements the DPLL algorithm focusing on unit propagation and without pure literal elimination.
- **CDCL Algorithm**: A robust implementation of the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm that includes:
    - Support for multiple heuristics.
    - Integration with Two Watched Literals (TWL) and True Two Watched Literals (TrueTWL) optimizations.
    - A 1UIP (First Unique Implication Point) cutting strategy for conflict resolution.
    - Enhanced conflict analysis and clause learning for efficient problem-solving. 
- **Logging and Decision Table**: Logs each decision step, including decision literals, implied literals, satisfied/contradicted clauses, and explanations.
- **Configurable Options**: Includes settings for using or skipping pure literal elimination, different heuristics and two watched literals.
- **Usage Examples**: Basic examples for the solver using `run_solver.py`.
- **Version Tests**: A list of tests for testing the solvers functionality using the `...version_test.py` files.
- **Benchamarks Tester**: A list of the instance the solver can solver and the solvers profiling using `run_SATLIB.py`

### Phase 2.1: Literal Count Heuristics and Clause Elimination Preparation

- **Literal Count Heuristics**: Adds branching heuristics (DLCS, DLIS, RDLCS, RDLIS) based on literal counts to guide decision-making, improving solver efficiency.
- **Clause Elimination Preparation**: Moved `pure_literal_elimination` to `clause_elimination_methods.py`, establishing a modular structure for future clause elimination techniques.

### Phase 2.2: Add MOM’s Heuristics

- **MOM's Heuristic**: Implements the Maximum Occurrences on clauses of Minimum size (MOM's) heuristic, which selects literals based on their frequency in the smallest unsatisfied clauses. MOM's heuristic uses a formula to prioritize literals that occur frequently, controlled by the parameter `k`.
- **RMOM's Heuristic**: Randomized version of MOM's, assigning a randomly chosen truth value (True/False) to the selected literal.
- **Flexible `k` Parameter**: Allows the user to adjust the sensitivity of MOM's heuristic through the `k` parameter, which influences literal selection. 

### Phase 3.0: Two Watched Literals (TWL) Optimization

- **Two Watched Literals**: Implements the Two Watched Literals optimization to improve unit propagation efficiency. By monitoring only two literals in each clause, this approach minimizes the number of literals checked at each decision level, making the solver more efficient for larger problems.
- **Integration with DPLL**: When twl=True is enabled, the solver converts the SAT problem instance to use the Two Watched Literals technique, making it compatible with the existing DPLL logic.

### Phase 3.1: DIMACS Clause Form Compatibility and Code Refactoring

- **DIMACS Reader**: A class that processes DIMACS .cnf files, extracting the problem's clauses, the number of literals, and the number of clauses for use in the solver.
- **Performance Testing**: Utilized cProfile and SnakeViz to benchmark the solver's performance with various SATLIB problem instances. This phase helped identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
- **Code Refactoring**: Following the performance analysis, significant changes were made to the codebase to optimize the solver's efficiency. While these improvements enhanced performance, they resulted in a decrease in code readability. 
- **Enhanced Project Structure**: As the project expanded, the code was reorganized into dedicated directories and modules to maintain clarity and manageability. This restructuring ensures easier navigation and scalability for future development.
- **Decision Literal Bug Fixed**: A bug was identified where the decision literal printed in the 'decision literal' column of the 'steps' log had incorrect polarity when heuristics other than the 'default' were used. This issue has now been resolved.

### Phase 3.2: PyPy, Poetry, Pytest and Code Refactoring
- **Project's Directory Changes**: The codebase and data files have been reorganized to improve structure and scalability. All source code and related modules are now housed in the src/sat_solver directory.
- **True Two Watched Literals**: Introduced `TrueTWLSATProblem`, a novel variation of the Two Watched Literals (TWL) optimization. This implementation provides an alternative mechanism for managing watched literals, offering potential performance improvements for certain SAT problem instances.
- **PyPy**: Full compatibility with `PyPy 3.10` has been achieved. PyPy significantly enhances runtime performance, making the solver more efficient for larger or more complex SATLIB problems.
- **Poetry**: The project now leverages Poetry for dependency management, virtual environments, and packaging. Key benefits include:
    - Simplified dependency installation with the poetry install command.
    - Isolated environments for better control over package versions and compatibility.
    - Easy configuration through the pyproject.toml file, which also defines metadata like the project's name, version, and supported Python versions.
- **Pytest**: Testing workflows have been modernized with Pytest, enabling:
    - Parametrized tests for heuristics and features, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
    - Simplified test discovery and execution with the poetry run pytest command.
    - Integration of fixtures for reusable test setups, improving maintainability and readability.

### Phase 3.2.1: Pydantic, Paths, and BCP/is_unsatisfied Logic Change 
- **Path Configuration Fix**: Resolved module import issues by addressing incorrect path configurations. Ensure your working directory is set to src/sat_solver during execution to avoid errors.
- **BCP Optimization**: Improved Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) logic for better performance.
- **is_unsatisfied Optimization**: Enhanced logic for detecting unsatisfied clauses, reducing overhead.
- **Pydantic Integration**: Structured and validated configurations using Pydantic for better robustness.
- **Pure Literal Elimination (PLE) Removal**: As outlined in previous phases, Pure Literal Elimination has now been fully deprecated and removed from the solver. Starting with this version, PLE is no longer supported, reflecting a shift towards more modern and efficient SAT solving techniques.

### Phase 4.0: CDCL Basic
- **CDCL Solver**: The first version of the CDCL algorithm has been implemented. This version is compatible with all available heuristics but does not yet support the Two Watched Literal scheme or its variation, TrueTWL. It exclusively uses the 1UIP (First Unique Implication Point) cutting method.
- **Loggers Folder**: The logging functionality, previously embedded within the DPLLSolver class, has been modularized into its own set of classes. These loggers are now shared between the DPLL and CDCL solvers.
- **CDCL Logger**: A new specialized logger for the CDCL solver has been introduced. It tracks the implication graph, which is critical for understanding and debugging the solver's decision-making process.
- **Data Folder**: A new directory has been added to organize test cases and test results for the CDCL solver. This folder ensures proper tracking and versioning of test data.
- **DPLL Version Tester**: The existing version tester has been renamed for clarity, reflecting its specialization for testing the DPLL solver.
- **CDCL Version Tester**: A new testing framework specifically designed to validate the functionality of the CDCL solver. It supports automated testing of various heuristics and configurations.
- **SATProblem Changes**: A new method, add_clauses, has been added to the SATProblem class to enable the dynamic addition of clauses. This change ensures proper compatibility with the CDCL solver.
- **Code Refactoring**: Significant improvements have been made to the DPLL solver codebase to enhance readability and maintainability. Large blocks of logic have been broken down into smaller, more manageable methods.

### Phase 4.1: CDCL FULL, Test Data Change, and Code Refactoring
- **Full TWL/TrueTWL Compatibility**: The CDCL solver has been upgraded to fully support the Two Watched Literals (TWL) and True Two Watched Literals (TrueTWL) optimizations. These enhancements improve solver efficiency and expand compatibility with various problem-solving scenarios.
- **Enhanced Test Data**: The results directories now include JSON files containing detailed logger outputs for each test problem. These outputs capture the solver's behavior under different heuristics and optimizations, providing a transparent view of its decision-making process.
- **create_result_data.py Script**: A new utility script has been added to generate the JSON files required by the version testers. This script streamlines the process of creating test result data, ensuring consistency and accuracy for solver verification.
- **Usage_Examples Directory**: A new directory has been introduced to separate solver testers from user-facing usage examples. It contains two illustrative examples demonstrating how to integrate and use the solver in real-world scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Code Refactoring**: Extensive updates were made to the CDCL solver’s codebase to resolve bugs encountered during the integration of TWL and TrueTWL optimizations. These refinements also improve code readability, maintainability, and overall robustness.

## Usage

1. To solve a SAT problem:
    ```python
    from sat_solver.DIMACS_Reader.clauses_model import ClausesModel
    from sat_solver.Solver.dpll_solver import DPLLSolver

    clauses = [[1, -3, 0], [-2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0], [-4, 0]]  # Example problem
    num_of_clauses = 4
    num_of_variables = 4
    clauses_model = ClausesModel(clauses=clauses, num_clauses=num_of_clauses, num_vars=num_of_variables)

    solver = DPLLSolver(clauses_model=clauses_model, use_logger=True, heuristic='moms', k=2, twl=False)

    is_satisfiable = solver.solve()
    print("Satisfiable:", is_satisfiable)

    # Print decision steps (optional)
    solver.print_steps()
    ```

    ```bash
    poetry shell  # Activates the Poetry environment
    cd src/sat_solver
    pypy script_folder/script_file.py  # Run tests
    exit # Exits the Poetry environment
    ```


2. **Selecting Heuristics**:
   The solver supports multiple heuristics, which can be set via the `heuristic` parameter in `DPLLSolver`. Options include:
   - `'default'`: A simple first unassigned literal heuristic.
   - `'dlcs'`, `'dlis'`, `'rdlcs'`, `'rdlis'`: Literal count-based heuristics.
   - `'moms'`: MOM’s heuristic, with configurable `k` (e.g., `heuristic='moms', k=2`).
   - `'rmoms'`: RMOM’s heuristic, which randomizes the truth value of the selected literal (e.g., `heuristic='rmoms', k=2`).

3. **Two Watched Literals (TWL)**:
    To enable Two Watched Literals, pass twl=True when initializing DPLLSolver.
    To enable True Two Watched Literals, pass true_twl=True when initializing DPLLSolver.

4. **Testing**:
   Run tests to verify the solver works correctly:
   ```bash
    poetry shell  # Activates the Poetry environment
    cd src/sat_solver
    pytest -v Testers/dpll_version_test.py  # Run tests
    pytest -v -s Testers/dpll_version_test.py  # Include logger output during test runs
    exit # Exits the Poetry environment
   ```

   Run all available tests for both solvers:
   ```bash
    poetry shell  # Activates the Poetry environment
    cd src/sat_solver
    pytest
    pytest -v # To view the list of tests
    exit # Exits the Poetry environment
   ```

5. **Performance Testing**:
   To test the solver's performance, use the run_SATLIB.py script. This will profile the solver's execution using cProfile, which can then be visualized with SnakeViz. To do so, run the following commands:
   ```bash
    poetry shell  # Activates the Poetry environment
    cd src/sat_solver
    pypy Usage_Examples/run_SATLIB.py # Execute tests with PyPy for performance comparison
    snakeviz Usage_Examples/profile_output.prof  # This opens a visualization of the profiling data
    exit # Exits the Poetry environment
   ```
