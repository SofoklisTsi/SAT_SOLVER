class TWLSATProblem(SATProblem):
    """
    Extended SATProblem class that incorporates the Two Watched Literals (TWL) technique.

    Attributes:
        original_clauses (List[List[int]]): The original SAT clauses, unchanged throughout execution.

    Inherited Attributes from SATProblem:
        clauses (List[List[int]]): Modified clauses where two watched literals are tracked per clause.
        clauses_by_literal (Dict[int, List[int]]): Mapping of literals to the indices of clauses where they appear.
        num_of_assigned_literals_that_satisfy_a_clause (List[int]): Tracks the count of assigned literals
            satisfying each clause.
        assignments (Dict[int, bool]): Current variable assignments.
        satisfaction_map (List[bool]): Indicates whether each clause is currently satisfied.
    
    Methods:
        _initialize_watched_literals(satisfaction_map, assignments):
            Initializes two watched literals for each clause.
        update_watched_literals(assigned_literal):
            Updates the watched literals when a literal's assignment changes.
